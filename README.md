## Overview
* **On-the-job ticket** or **feature request Challenges** are starter code given to use to modify and improve upon. 

Challenges follow an **agile project management** format that's commonly used by software development teams to manage their work. Practicing this helps prepare for the workflows we'll experience as a professional full-stack web developer. 

To learn more about agile, read this [Wikipedia article on agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).
​
### The challenge
​
Refractor (improving it without changing what it does) an existing/starter code to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers.

Adhere to the **Scout Rule**: always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it. And ensure **accessibility** standards.
​
### User Story
​
AS AN aspiring web developer, I WANT to prepare for the type of workflow that the role would call for, SO THAT I can better contribute to my team.
​
### Acceptance Criteria
​
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
